Hey so this is my submission for the homework

I have two folders, one is for the crawler stand alone application, and the other is for the search with page rank implemented for it

SOOOOOOO for the crawler to compile, just use:
g++ -g -Wall crawler.cpp -o crawler
and then use it like you normally would with like command line arguments


and then Search has a config reading implemented on it too, so you just need to load the config file in the command line argument (otherwise it defaults to config.txt) and then TA-DAH!! you should have a working search engine WITH PAGERANK!!!!
