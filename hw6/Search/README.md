Hey so this is my submission for the homework of Search


and  Search has a config reading implemented on it too, so you just need to load the config file in the command line argument (otherwise it defaults to config.txt) and then TA-DAH!! you should have a working search engine WITH PAGERANK!!!!



** ALSO!! I designed my pagerank to take into account self loops for the value calculation, but I made it so the number of incoming and outgoing links stay the same as if there was not an inputted self loop **
